1.Platform Independence:
		Java is Platform Independent because it as a byte code.Java doesnâ€™t require the entire code to be re-written for all the different platforms.
		It supports platform independence by using Java byte-code and Java Virtual Machine.javac is converted .java to .class means
		it convert source code into bytecode.
		
		
2.		Primitive :                          
				*Primitive data types dose not have state and behavior.
				*Primitive types are predefined
				*data types start with Lower case
				*A primitive type has always a value.
				*8 Primitive data types int,float,long,short,boolean,double,
				
		Non-Primitive:
				*non-Primitive data types has State and behavior
				*Non-primitive types are created by the programmer and is not defined 
				*it starts with Upper case
				*non-primitive types can be null.
				*non primitive data type evrey object/class is is non primitive dtat type
				*String,Array
3.class and its members	:
		class is a instance of object.it has variables,keywords,method,data type,
		variables: used to reference the value of datatype. it has 4 different varables Local ,static,Instance,Parameter
		Local:it means declare with in the method
		static :declare with in the class using ststic keywords
			eg :static String name;
		instance:declare outside the method 
		parameter:Passing the value inside the parameter when method calls
		DataType:which is used to hold the address of variables
			eg:	int age=20
			
4.write a program to accept two inputs total marks and received marks,claculate percentage and return

	class Marks
	{
		static long totalMarks;
		System.out.println("Total marks :"+totalMarks);
		static long marks;
		float percentage=(marks*100)/totalmarks;
		return  0;
		if(percentage>60)
		{
		System.out.println("Eligable for this job"+percentage);
		
		}
		else{
		System.out.println("Eligable for this job"+percentage};
	}
		
		
		
5. Remove duplicates in an below array
		int[] values={34,78,90,53,34,11,53,15,78,91,8,4,67,11};

	class duplicate{
		static int[] values={34,78,90,53,34,11,53,15,78,91,8,4,67,11};
		
		if(values[index]=values[index])
		{
		for(int i=0;i<=values.length;i++)
		{
		int point;
		values.length[i]=point;
		point=null;
		return 0;
		}
		else{
		System.out.println(values[]);
		}
		
		}
	}
	
	
6,explain main method with the memory it executes
		There are two kinds of memory used in Java. These are called stack memory and heap memory.Whenever we declare new variables and objects, 
		call a new method, declare a String

		
7,program to find reverse of a number
8,program to find hourse into sec
9,program to find Armstrong number
