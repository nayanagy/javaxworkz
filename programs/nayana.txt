1.Platform Independence:
		Java is Platform Independent because it as a byte code.javc is converted .java to .class means it convert source code into bytecode.
		"WORA"it means Write once read anywhare.java is high level Object oriented programming language and it is platform independence because
		it has byte code and it is secure autentication System based on Public key encription and it has byte code
		
2.		Primitive :                          
				*Primitive data types dose not have state and behavior.
				*data types start with Lower case
				*8 Primitive data types int,float,long,short,boolean,double,
				
		Non-Primitive:
				*non-Primitive data types has State and behavior
				*it starts with Upper case
				*non primitive data type evrey object/class is is non primitive dtat type
				*String,Array
3.class and its members	:
		class is a instance of object.it has variables,keywords,method,data type,
		variables: used to reference the value of datatype. it has 4 different varables Local ,static,Instance,Parameter
		Local:it means declare with in the method
		static :declare with in the class using ststic keywords
			eg :static String name;
		instance:declare outside the method 
		parameter:Passing the value inside the parameter when method calls
		DataType:which is used to hold the address of variables
			eg:	int age=20
			
4.write a program to accept two inputs total marks and received marks,claculate percentage and return

	class Marks
	{
		static long totalMarks;
		System.out.println("Total marks :"+totalMarks);
		static long marks;
		float percentage=(marks*100)/totalmarks;
		return  0;
		if(percentage>60)
		{
		System.out.println("Eligable for this job"+percentage);
		
		}
		else{
		System.out.println("Eligable for this job"+percentage};
	}
		
		
		
5. Remove duplicates in an below array
		int[] values={34,78,90,53,34,11,53,15,78,91,8,4,67,11};

	class duplicate{
		static int[] values={34,78,90,53,34,11,53,15,78,91,8,4,67,11};
		
		if(values[index]=values[index])
		{
		for(int i=0;i<=values.length;i++)
		{
		int point;
		values.length[i]=point;
		point=null;
		return 0;
		}
		else{
		System.out.println(values[]);
		}
		
		}
	}
	
	
6,explain main method with the memory it executes

		in the memory is called heap memory , String stored in heap memory it creates frame,and it as constant pool,intstance memory ,meta space,
		* values stored in constant pool
7,program to find reverse of a number
8,program to find hourse into sec
9,program to find Armstrong number
